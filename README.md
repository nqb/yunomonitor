# yunomonitor
Easy monitoring for YunoHost

## Features
This script allow you to monitor easily your servers. You can check outside the server to monitor:
* Ping of domains you use in your servers
* Availibility of your web app (HTTP 200 answer)
* TLS certificate correctly renewed
* Resolver DNS are up
* DNS are well configured
* All mail things are ok (SMTP, IMAP, Blacklist)
* XMPP is working

And inside the server to monitor:
* DNS resolution is correctly done
* Services are up
* Health of your hard drive disk
* Free space available
* Backup are correctly done

If you are using YunoHost, all this things are configured automatically from the configuration of the YunoHost to monitor.

This script supports ipv4 and ipv6.

It is extensible to add other kind of checks plugin and other kinds of actions (alert) plugin.

## Usage
On the server to monitor:
```
*/8 * * * * some_user python3 yunomonitor.py -e MONITORING_SERVER [...]
```

On the monitoring server:
```
*/8 * * * * some_user python3 yunomonitor.py [SERVER_TO_MONITOR ...] [-m MAIL [MAIL ...]] [-s URL_SMS] [-c URL_CACHET]
```

## Dependencies

This script is designed to run with these dependencies:
* python3-yaml
* python3-dnspython
* python3-requests-toolbelt
* an SMTP server running on the machine

If you want to use the autoconfiguration mechanism, you need to configure on nginx a HTTPS `.well-known/yunomonitor/` path. You need also in this case to have on monitoring server a ssh key on /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key

## Checks
Here is a list of all checks methods. Each method return a list of small messages that describe errors append.

### ping
NO_IPV4_PING: 
NO_IPV6_PING:

### https_200
DOMAIN_UNCONFIGURED:
DOMAIN_MISCONFIGURED_IN_IPV4:
CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED, msg:
PORT_CLOSED_OR_SERVICE_DOWN, ip, msg:
TIMEOUT, ip, msg:
TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS, ip, msg:
SSO_CAPTURE:
UNKNOWN_ERROR, ip, msg:
HTTP_XXX, msg:

### domain_renewed
CERT_RENEWAL_FAILED


## Alerts
### Mail alerts
This module send one email by failures checks.

### SMS alerts
This module send a condensate  of all failures on all servers in one sms (sms apis are rarely free).

### Cachet update
This module update components in cachet and open incident with information that could be shown publicly.

## Why this script is in one file ?
Because in some case, I need to deploy it quickly. An unique file is simple.

I have analyzed solution like nagios and zabbix, and these tools are very powerfull, but the cost to deploy and configure it is to high for my objective to deploy YunoHost with monitoring and backup automatically.

## Bypass automatic configuration tools
You can create a configuration file that will be used instead of the one generated by placing it in /etc/yunomonitor/DOMAIN.conf

```
